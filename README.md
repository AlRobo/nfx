NFX
===
 The name "NFX" stands for ".NET Framework Extension" / "Unistack". "Unistack" = "Unified Software Stack", a conceptually-monolithic library that facilitates
 creation of whatever components developers need, to create a scale-able, solid business/data-driven application systems (not just applications). 
 As such, the unistack support many facilities that traditionally are scattered among myriads of disjoint software frameworks.
